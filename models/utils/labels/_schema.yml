      Manual labels and categorizations maintained by Entropy. Each row represents
      a known address on a specific blockchain with a human-readable name, protocol label,
      entity type, and category. Used as the whitelist and enrichment source for all
      downstream models — filter by `type` and/or `category` to scope queries.
      Add new rows here to expand coverage without touching any other model.
